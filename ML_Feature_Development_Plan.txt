Outline for ML Feature Development Plan

- Auto-Prompt Feature: Implement an ML model to analyze the content of a slide and suggest relevant information or graphics.
- Copilot-Like Suggestions: Develop an AI assistant that provides real-time suggestions for slide improvements and content optimization.
- Verbal Communication Features: Integrate speech-to-text capabilities for creating and editing presentations through voice commands.
- Template Generation: Use ML to generate slide templates based on user preferences and popular design trends.
- Content Customization: Create a system for automatic content layout adjustment on slides for optimal visual appeal.
- Accessibility Features: Incorporate ML to ensure presentations are accessible, including automatic alt-text generation for images.
- Data Integration: Allow the application to pull in data from external sources and incorporate it into presentations intelligently.
- Collaboration Tools: Implement ML algorithms for real-time collaboration, version control, and edit suggestions.
- User Feedback Loop: Establish a system where the application learns from user edits and feedback to improve AI suggestions.
- Open Source Libraries: Ensure all ML features are built using open-source libraries to keep the application free for Linux users.
